# DarkOrbit Teleport Bot
A bot for DarkOrbit, which travels the player from the home map to the next map, and then teleports back, in an attempt to be teleported to the Easter egg map.

This program has been (manually) translated from AutoHotKey. The original version can be found at this [repository](https://github.com/Aleksbgbg/AHK-Scripts/tree/master/DarkOrbit%20Teleport%20Bot).
